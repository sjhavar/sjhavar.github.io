              To me fitness is much more than weight lifting, calisthenics, and
              cardio. With gains that surpass being pumped, ripped, and sweaty.
              Fitness became my light, my rock, and salvation at a time when life
              was dark, unstable, and chaotic. I grew up in a single parent home
              of seven, in a crime stricken town in Boston where options were
              limited and positive role models scarce. Scare became extinct once
              the single parent home I grew up in became a zero parent home. I
              lost my mother at the age of fifteen and with her went my desire to
              live. In reverie I lost my mother way before she passed away on the
              operating table. She was a type one diabetic with high blood
              pressure and high cholesterol and the daily medication she was
              prescribed slowly ate the life of her. It took a while for me to
              come to terms with her death but once accepted I refused to succumb
              to the same tragedy. That’s when fitness became my therapist and
              the gym became that long comfortable sofa where I let it all out.
              Everyone struggles and faces adversity at some point in life and
              holding it in does much more harm than good. Fitness was how I
              released that stress and I’m here to help others experience the
              beauty I found through fitness.

                  I started working with Joel a
                   few months ago and within a
                  couple sessions of working out with him, I've started to see
                  changes in the mirror. He works me hard but in an encouraging
                  and positive environment that gets myself to push myself harder
                  with him and when I work out by myself. I've been really happy
                  with my progress so far!

                  “Let’s just put it this way – a friend and I
                  (both physically active working girls) have separately been
                  training with Joel for the past few months, and quickly came
                  up with the hashtag #bodybyjoel. Endlessly creative with his
                  (killer) workouts, Joel is also kind, patient (a quality I
                  occasionally test …) and extremely reliable. I can’t count the
                  number of people to whom I’ve passed on his number and praises.
                  I would recommend Joel in a heartbeat.”
